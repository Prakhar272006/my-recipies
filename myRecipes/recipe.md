Step 1 – Making Pizza Dough



Here’s how to make the best, easiest pizza dough from scratch:

1. First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.


2. Add 1 cup of warm water  and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.


3. You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.

4. Combine 1 cup of  all purpose flour  with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of  oil.

5. Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon.

6. Add one more cup of the flour.

7. Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky, like in the photo below.

8. Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.

9. Now it’s time to knead the dough by hand until it forms a smooth dough. Dust with flour to prevent sticking as you work. The dough will be soft and elastic, and no longer sticky.


10. Keep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of  oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough   grows.

Cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel, and let rest at room temperature for the dough to leaven


11. After exactly 1 hour my dough had risen and doubled up 


12. To make the pizza right away, portion and flatten the dough to a disk. 


Step 3 – Assembling and baking

1. First, preheat the oven to the highest temperature in your oven. In my oven it is 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit). Grease a round metal baking pan with  oil

2. Divide the pizza dough into equals parts to make either 4 small or 2 large or 3 medium size pizzas. Wrap any dough you’re not using in plastic wrap 


3. Using clean, dry hands, take one portion of the divided dough and roll it into a neat round ball. Place on a cutting board or countertop that’s been lightly coated with some flour, and sprinkle the dough with a light dusting of more flour.

4. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a large round or oval shape . Roll the dough from the center towards the outer edges for the most even pizza dough. You may have to dust the surface with flour as you work.



5. Once stretched to the desired size, gently place the pizza base in the greased baking pan

6. At this point you can prick the dough with a fork if you want a thinner, crisper crust. This also helps in the crust not puffing up when baking. However, you can leave the dough as-is for a fluffier, chewier veg pizza crust.

7. Use a  brush to lightly brush the surface of the crust with olive oil.

8. Then, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza in a thin, even layer. Leave about an inch of dough around the outer edge free from sauce for a perfect pizza crust.

9. Top the sauce with a generous handful or two of shredded mozzarella cheese.

10. Place your choice of veggies on top of the cheese, making sure to spread the toppings evenly.

11. Next, add a light layer of grated processed cheese to finish the pizza.

12. Place the baking pan close to the lower heating element  to get the crispiest crust and perfectly molten, gooey melted cheese. Bake the veg pizza in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese melts and the crust is golden.


14. Your pizza is ready add a few topping and dery herbes...ENJOY!
